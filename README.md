### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd campus-sphere
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Set up Supabase:
   - Create a new Supabase project
   - Copy your project URL and anon key
   - Update the `.env.local` file with your Supabase credentials:

```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
```

4. **IMPORTANT**: Run the database migrations:
   - Go to your Supabase dashboard
   - Navigate to SQL Editor
   - Copy and paste the contents of `supabase/migrations/create_initial_schema.sql`
   - Execute the SQL to create all necessary tables and security policies

5. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

6. **Setup Demo Users** (First Time Only):
   - Click the "Setup Demo Users" button on the login page
   - This will create demo accounts for all user roles

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

If you encounter "Invalid login credentials" errors:
